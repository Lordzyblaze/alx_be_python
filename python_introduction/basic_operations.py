#Assign specific values to two variables, number1 and number2 
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.

sum = number1 + number2
sub = number2 - number1
mul = number1 * number2

# Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format.

print ("Addition of 10 and 5 is", sum)
print ("Substruction of 10 and 5 is", sub)
print ("Multiplication of 10 and 5 is", mul)
